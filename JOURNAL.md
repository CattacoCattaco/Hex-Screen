## 11/8/2025 - Research and Obtain Neopixels  

I did some research into how to control a lot of LEDs efficiently and learned about NeoPixels, which use timings to control many LEDs that are put in series rather than needing a different data source for each one. I then bought 100 NeoPixel 3535 minis from Digikey using a grant I got from the Summer of Making shop to try to make sure they work how I thought. They arrived and I realized just how tiny they are and that they aren't very easy to connect to a breadboard for testing. They seem to be what I need though so I will likely use them in the final product.
